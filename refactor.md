### Refactoring Ideas:

#### Separation of Concerns:
- **Extract Fetch Functions**: Move fetch functions (e.g., `fetchMediaFiles`, `populateData`) into a separate module for better organization.
- **Divide Event Listeners**: Group event listeners based on their functionality (e.g., upload, sidebar toggle) for better readability.

#### Modularization:
- **Modularize UI Manipulation**: Extract UI manipulation functions (e.g., creating elements, updating content) into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Abstract File Handling**: Create functions to handle file-related operations (e.g., upload, remove) to improve maintainability.

#### Improve Readability:
- **Reduce Function Size**: Break down large functions into smaller, focused ones for easier understanding.
- **Clarify Variable Names**: Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability and maintainability.

#### Error Handling:
- **Centralize Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to handle errors consistently throughout the codebase.
- **Refactor Error Messages**: Standardize error messages for better clarity and debugging.

#### Optimization:
- **Optimize DOM Manipulation**: Minimize direct DOM manipulation and use efficient techniques like templating or virtual DOM.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for resources (e.g., images, videos) to improve performance.

#### Code Formatting:
- **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure consistent code formatting (e.g., indentation, spacing) for better readability and maintainability.
- **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate redundant code and streamline repetitive patterns to make the code more concise.
